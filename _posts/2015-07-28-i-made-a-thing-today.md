title: "I Made A Thing Today"
---

A few months ago I left a job which was perfectly fine where I worked with a lot of people who were good at their jobs and were nice to me, but I hated it. The work didn't feed my brain. The culture didn't feed my spirit. And I was taking space from someone who could do it a lot better than I could. 

I have to believe that God was directing my steps, because a number of things happened and I was able to stop working for a while and start learning front-end web development. I really should have been doing this all along.

So I've been studying online with the good folks at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) to begin learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  I've also picked up some Sass, Gulp, Jekyll, exposure to GitHub and CodePen,  and lots of other little things I will be putting into practice very soon.

Today, after finishing the lessons on creating a blog with Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub, I made this. It's very basic right now, and mostly modeled on the example used in the lessons. The orchid logo is my own design. As time goes on and my skills increase, I will improve the site and posts will show you other things I have been working on. I'll probably also share some very non-digital things because it's important to exercise body and mind in as many ways as you can.

Thanks for reading this far. You can follow me on Twitter, sign up for the RSS feed, or click on the Contact link and send an e-mail.

>I will mention God and Jesus and my relationship with them from time to time on this blog. If you'd like to know more about what I believe we can chat separately. I'm not preaching; it's an integral part of my life. I hope we can all respect each other in that.
