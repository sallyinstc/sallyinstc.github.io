This is a simple blog about things digital and analog which I encounter, work on, or just find interesting. I hope you find them interesting, too. 

Why Blue Orchid? The "blue" part is pretty simple: like 80% of the world population, it's my favorite color. As for the orchid, that was a little harder to find. 

I think everyone has been, at least once, trying to do or be or accomplish something that seems like it should be easy, but it's not. Come on, we're smart, educated, capable people. Why is this so hard? Then I was struck with a thought: If you're an orchid, don't try to grow in the rose garden. Roses are beautiful, smell wonderful, and are so very carefully cultivated. But they are not orchids. And neither is an orchid a rose. So if you're an orchid, then be one. Don't try to be a rose; don't resent those who are; and try to let all the flowers flourish where they do best.
