Building simple static sites that are functional and look professional has become increasingly accessible during the last two years with static site generators. At last count, according to [staticstitegenerators.net](staticstitegenerators.net), there are four-hundred twelve options. The open-source directory [staticgen.com](staticge.com), maintained by *Smashing Magazine*, tracks the volume and popularity of static site generator projects on GitHub. As of this writing three that are at the top in rankings of stars and forked projects are Jekyll, Hexo, and Hugo.

[Jekyll](jekyllrb.com)
Most recent full release: 3.0 on 2015-10-26. The most popular in both stars and forks, and the power behind GitHub Pages, Jekyll is the one that sets the bar. It is a Ruby gem that does not use databases, is blog-aware, and utilizes Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS. For those who prefer to use Sass, it's already built into the software. Jekyll's flexibility allows for three options for installing plugins: in the _plugins directory, in the _config.yml file, or adding the code to a Bundler group in the Gemfile, as well as allowing for simultaneously using any two or all three options. The community is very dedicated and prolific, creating themes and plugins available within and outside of GitHub. Jekyll is very well documented and continually updated. The website provides links to additional blogs on the website and even more are available as well in the wiki.

[Hexo]hexo.io)                                              
Most recent full release: 3.0 on 2015-03-05. Written in JavaScript and using EJS and Swig templates, Hexo is a fast blog framework with posts written in Markdown for which there is full support of GitHub Flavors. Most of the Octopress plugins work in Hexo, as well as plugins for Jade and CoffeeScript. Installation requires Git and Node.js. The documentation is rich and includes guides for migrating from RSS, Jekyll, Octopress, Wordpress, and Joomla. The website currently features eighty-four plugins and thirty-five themes, including themes for sites migrated from Wordpress, Bootstrap, and Jekyll.

[Hugo]gohugo.io)
Most recent full release: 0.15.0 on 2015-11-25. Written with Go and using the Go HTML/template library, Hugo is a powerful yet light weight static site generator. Since the previous release, Hugo has begun using their concept external helpers, which allows for calling externally files with associated extensions. Making those external calls may slow performance. As of 2016-02-49 there are more than seventy themes featured on the website and include Jekyll, Bootstrap, and WordPress themes. The website menu features a tutorial for migrating from Jekyll, and another menu item leads to tools for converting from Ghost, Octopress, WordPress, Drupal, Blogger, andContentful. There are also tools for deployment, GUI frontends, and other plugins.
