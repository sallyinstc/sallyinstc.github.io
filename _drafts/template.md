>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. --African Proverb

I read an article by Cade Metz on [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com) which you can see [here](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/github-data-shows-changing-software-landscape/), that showed open source development has increased hugely in the last few years. This made me feel very happy for many reasons, not the least of which is the availability of tools to help make me a better programmer.

Then I started really thinking about collaboration, working in teams, the common good. What we know, or think we know, about human history seems to point to collaboration being the way we have managed to survive this long. Hunter-gatherers worked in groups, and everyone benefitted. As agrarian society grew, those who shared the labor and the knowledge helped everyone be successful. Living in groups also has defensive benefits. And it's not just about food-shelter-clothing. Every major world religion teaches that we are meant to live in fellowship with one another. Each of us keeps the other. So I started thinking about how I use collaboration in my life to make myself better. 

The first place I looked was in my garden. For the last few years I have had a plot in the community garden in my town where I grow tomatoes, beans, pumpkins, and other things most people with gardens grow. I even can my harvest for the winter. Even though my parents, in-laws, grandparents, and many other family members had farms and gardens and "put up" supplies for winter, I went into this with just a little information. Over the seasons various problems have arisen, and I've had to go looking for answers. I talked to others at the community garden; I looked up various gardening and preserving websites; I spoke with elders around me (Please, speak to the elders of whatever community you are in. They are a wealth of knowledge and often pretty cool to hang with, too!). Every year  I learn more. 

Next, I thought about my other hobbies: knitting and sewing. I'm not especially good at either one, but they keep me out of trouble. Knitting especially has a huge online presence in the form of the  [Ravelry](http://Ravelry.com) community, a social network for knitting, crochet, spinning, and all other related things. There are currently more than one-million members, all eager to help each other advance the craft. My experience has been the same with this as it has been with the garden. I am sure this is true of any art or craft out there. 

This brings me to the newest thing in my life: website development. Again I find a community of people who want to help other learn, provide tools, and advance the craft. Now, the tech world is huge and varied. As with any business based on innovation, there are times that development should be kept private. After all, companies are in business to make money. I'm a big fan of money myself. But once new thing is released to the world, it benefits far more people to let others see what they can make it do, too. Plus, there are a lot more opportunities to find things that don't quite work and make them better. That's a big benefit.

In this new era of connectedness, people have found their groups in ways that just were not possible before and communities are being built.  At the outset I talked about how collaboration is built-in for humans. We have an opportunity now to embrace a way of thinking that can allow for innovation and benefit for everyone. I hope we can do it.
