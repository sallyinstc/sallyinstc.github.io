Goal setting is one of the most effective tools any business has. Having clearly defined goals is how teams and organizations can know where they are going and whether or not they have gotten there. Having goals structured as Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-focused, and Time-bound (SMART) ensures that not only is a destination defined, but also that everyone stays on the road.

Specific Goals Every company wants to increase sales, be more efficient, outpace the competition, and generally be better than everyone else. Those are high-level goals. Specific goals are much more focused, the steps to achieving the higher goals. For instance, what needs to happen to increase sales? The specific goals may include expanding the outside sales force, increasing customer contact, or encouraging up-selling by the inside sales force.
Measurable Goals Goals that cannot be measured become open to interpretation. If the goal is to increase awareness, the question is: How many in an awareness? Measurable goals leave no room for ambiguity: increase click-through rate by 20%; add five new customers in six months; up-sell every third caller.

Achievable While it is good to stretch, a goal that is out of reach will only result in disappointment. Companies that continually challenge themselves to work to the next step move forward, but those that set unreasonable goals will always be behind.

Results-focused To be clear, results are simply what happens. Being results-focused means taking the results, whether expected or not, and analyzing them. Did the efforts result in success as defined by the specific and measurable goals? Why or why not? Where can improvements be made?

Time-bound Open, undefined timelines allow goals to slip in priority. Time, in the sense of work, is finite: only so many hours in a day, only so many days in the week. It's a tight budget, so where that time is spent is a critical decision. Knowing that a goal has an end date makes it possible to plan, and to asses along the way whether the plan is effective.
